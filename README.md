Why hibernate?

â†’ Hibernate is an ORM ( object relation Mapping )  tool for java. 

    Using this we can map java Classes to database tables and even java datatypes to sql datatypes.

- Saves lot of time in developing database extensive applications , so  we can focus more on business logic.
- Write CRUD operations without actually writing SQL queries.
- HQL allows to write Object Oriented Queries for advanced operations
- Implementation of JPA , so has high interoperability with other java EE apps.
